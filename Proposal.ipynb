       "Redfin got its start inventing map-based search.   Everyone told us the easy money was in running ads for traditional brokers, but we couldn’t stop thinking about how different real estate would be if it were designed from the ground up, using technology and totally different values, to put customers first.   So we joined forces with agents who wanted to be customer advocates, not salesmen.   Since these were our own agents, we could survey each customer on our service and pay a bonus based on the review.   We deepened our technology beyond the initial search to make the home tour, the listing debut, the escrow process, the whole process, faster, easier and worry-free.   And we gave customers more value, not just by saving each thousands in fees, but by investing in every home we sell, by measuring our performance and improving constantly.   This is how real estate would be if it were designed just for consumers, because, well, it was.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",

       "Fuwei Films (Holdings) Co., Ltd. (\"Fuwei Films\" or the \"Company\") was formed in August 2004. Fuwei Films conducts its business operations through its wholly owned subsidiary Fuwei Films (Shandong) Co., Ltd. (\"Shandong Fuwei\").   We develop, manufacture and distribute high quality plastic film using the biaxial oriented stretch technique, otherwise known as BOPET film (biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate). The film is suitable for many forms of flexible packaging, printing, laminating, aluminum-plating and other applications. In addition, it retains high dielectric strength and volume resistance even at high temperatures, which are essential qualities for electrical and electronic uses. Our BOPET film is widely used in consumer based packaging (such as the food, pharmaceutical, cosmetics, tobacco and alcohol industries), imaging (such as masking film, printing plates and microfilms), electronics and electrical industries (such as wire and cable wrap, capacitors and motor insulation), as well as in magnetic products (such as audio and video tapes). We market our products under our brand name “Fuwei Films.” Our customers include some of the world’s largest companies engaged in flexible packaging, including Alcan, Inc. of Canada. We also export our products to packaging customers and distributors in the US, Japan and Southeast Asia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",
